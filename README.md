3. Readme.md

4. R script

### The script 'run_analysis.R' executes the foll:

 1. Merges training and the test sets to create combined data set.

 2. Extracts only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name activities in data set

 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

 5. From the data set in step 4, create a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
